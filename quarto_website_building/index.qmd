In this website I will go through my project of investigating how certain players' skill rating are determined based on in-game match data. Due to the limited amount of available player data for competitive video games, I will only examine the mainstream competitive video game: *League of Legends*.


### Project Organization

##### <ins>Introduction:</ins>
For the introduction I wanted to give some contextual information about me as well as the idea that I had for this Data Science project. This section contains an intro about me, an intro about my project, the data that I used, and the code that I made. 

- [About Me](https://shawnhxu.github.io/EnhancingSBMM/about_me/about_me.html)
- [Code](https://shawnhxu.github.io/EnhancingSBMM/code.html)
- [Data](https://shawnhxu.github.io/EnhancingSBMM/data.html)
- [Introduction](https://shawnhxu.github.io/EnhancingSBMM/introduction.html)

##### <ins>Data Preparation:</ins>
For the Data Preparation section, I worked on retrieving textual and record data from the Riot API. More information can be found in the following tabs.

- [Data Gathering](https://shawnhxu.github.io/EnhancingSBMM/data_gathering.html)
- [Data Cleaning](https://shawnhxu.github.io/EnhancingSBMM/data_cleaning.html)
- [Data Exploration](https://shawnhxu.github.io/EnhancingSBMM/eda.html)

##### <ins>Techniques:</ins>
Here lists some of techniques that I used on my retrieved data. Namely, I used Naive Bayes classification, Dimensionality Reduction, Clustering, and some Decision Tree classification techniques.

- [Dimensionality Reduction](https://shawnhxu.github.io/EnhancingSBMM/dim_red.html)
- [Clustering](https://shawnhxu.github.io/EnhancingSBMM/clustering.html)
- [Decision Trees](https://shawnhxu.github.io/EnhancingSBMM/decision_tree.html)
  
##### <ins>Conclusion:</ins>
A small concluding segment where I talk about my findings and how it relates back to my project idea.
