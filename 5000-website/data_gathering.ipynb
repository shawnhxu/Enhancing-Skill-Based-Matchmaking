        "The primary API (Application Programming Interface) that I will be accessing to receive data for my Data Science Project is the Riot API provided by Riot Games. The competitive video game that I would like to primarily research about and obtain data for is the game League of Legends (LoL). Since this game has been around since 2009 and that the game features many many different possible recordable information, I found LoL to be the perfect subject for my Data Science data-driven project. What's more is that the Riot API includes many options to retrieve information from.\n",

        "One of the biggest reasons I chose LoL as the primary video game to research about is, again, the amount of information I can include in my dataset but also the ease of access in this information from the Riot Games API. Unlike many other games, the Riot API for LoL allows any users or developers to have free access to many functions. A function that really caught my attention and influenced me to choose the Riot API and LoL is the function that allows users to find lists of player names and their respective ID's. This is significantly useful because my research topic relates to how to determine a player's respective rank based on their benchmarks of match data. By being able to have access to these I am thus able to retrieve the player's most recent games and filtering their ranked games to get their most serious effort in terms of match data. \n",

        "From domain knowledge, the ladder queue called \"Ranked Solo/Duo 5v5\" is the most commonly played queue and is considered the best way to compare a player's skill rating in most regions. This queue features the option to play a match of five players versus 5 players of equal skill rating. This data is in fact included in the API when retrieving a certain match's data. Each match has information about which participants are in the match and their respective 'puuid'. Then each participant would have their own information for each category of data which can be easily indexed after retrieving the match data.\n",

By doing so, the method I chose to replace those rows of the wrong queue ladder type would be to simply append rows of ```NA```'s. This would have to be removed later in Data Cleaning.
