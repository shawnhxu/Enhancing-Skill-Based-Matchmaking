        "## About Me\n",
        "Hello, I am Shawn Xu and I am currently a student in the M.S. Data Science and Analytics program at <ins>Georgetown University</ins>. Before attending Georgetown University, I received my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from <ins>Boston University</ins> where I focused mainly on biomedical lab research on proteins. A primary experience of mine was focused on the implications of protein degradation in the treatment of cancer. Now transitioning to Data Science, I hope to implement what I learned and will learn into my interests and hobbies.\n",
