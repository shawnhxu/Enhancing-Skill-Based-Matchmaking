In this website I will go through my project of investigating how certain players' skill rating are determined based on in-game match data. Due to the limited amount of available player data for competitive video games, I will only examine the mainstream competitive video game: *League of Legends*.


### Project Organization

##### <ins>Introduction:</ins>
For the introduction I wanted to give some contextual information about me as well as the idea that I had for this Data Science project. This section contains in intro about me, an intro about my project, the data that I used, and the code that I made.

##### <ins>Data Preparation:</ins>
For the Data Preparation section, I worked on retrieving textual and record data from the Riot API. More information can be found in the following tabs.
